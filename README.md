NYC Taxi Data Analytics & Engineering Platform
A robust batch data pipeline project using PySpark and Databricks, built as part of a Data Engineering Technical Assessment. This project processes NYC TLC Yellow & Green taxi trip data to power analytics through a dimensional model, performance-optimized Spark jobs, and insightful SQL queries.

 Project Summary
 Built a modular ETL pipeline with PySpark on Databricks

 Processed 3 months of NYC Yellow & Green taxi trip data

 Designed a Star Schema for analytical workloads

 Applied data quality rules, outlier filtering, and aggregations

 Created reusable analysis queries to uncover revenue patterns and ride behaviors

 Architecture & Data Flow
Ingest raw CSV files → transform with PySpark → write Delta tables

Star Schema model supports fast querying and reporting

Stored curated data in Azure Data Lake

Partitioned by time/location for optimization

Prepared for future enhancements like streaming ingestion

 Data Modeling Highlights
Component	Description
 fact_trips	Trip-level fact table with cleaned and enriched data
 Dimensions	Zones, Rate Codes, Payment Types
 SCD Types	Type 2 for Zones & Payment Types, Type 1 for Rate Codes
 Aggregations	Revenue trends, long trips, weekday/weekend patterns

📄 View Model Design

 ETL Logic (PySpark)
 Implemented in combined_taxi.ipynb:

Trip duration & average speed computation

Outlier detection (e.g., 0 fare, abnormal durations)

 Zone enrichment via joins

 Time-based partitioning (hour/day/month)

 Aggregation tables for revenue and trip analysis

 Data validation and quality enforcement

 Analysis & Business Queries
 Top 10 Pickup Zones by Revenue
queries/top_10_pickups.sql

 Trip Patterns: Weekday vs Weekend
queries/weekday_weekend_patterns.sql

 Top 10 Longest Trips (>10 miles)
queries/top_10_long_trips.sql

 Performance & Optimization
 Broadcast joins for small lookup tables

 Delta Lake + predicate pushdown

 Partitioning by pickup datetime and zone

 Pre-aggregated summary tables for BI tools

 Indexed keys and compacted tables for efficiency
